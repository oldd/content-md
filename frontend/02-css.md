We're not going to spend much time digging deeper into CSS, this is better learnt by doing. We do expect you to use CSS or a framework like Bootstrap in all your projects. It's not enough to have an app or website functionally working, it also has to look pretty to the user.

Responsive Web Design
---
Responsive Web design is the approach that suggests that design and development should respond to the user’s behavior and environment based on screen size, platform and orientation.

The practice consists of a mix of flexible grids and layouts, images and an intelligent use of CSS media queries. As the user switches from their laptop to iPad, the website should automatically switch to accommodate for resolution, image size and scripting abilities. In other words, the website should have the technology to automatically respond to the user’s preferences. This would eliminate the need for a different design and development phase for each new gadget on the market.

Frameworks
---

I would recommend starting with **Bootstrap**. It's easy to understand and use and adheres to the Responsive Design and Mobile First paradigm.

Optionally you can look into **Semantic-UI** or **Materialize**, but only if you feel comfortable enough designing websites with CSS.
