# GROUP PROJECTING 
This project is all about process.  We don't care what you build together, we care that you divide the work effectively and don't get too angry with eachother.  
As with all projects, the finished product is a complete and helpful github repo.

This repo contains (hopefully) enough resources to get you started:
1. Agile development and scrum.
2. An app planning process.
3. Questions to ask your code
4. Testing paradigms
5. Index of terms:
    * User story
    * Dependency chart
    * Deployment schedule
    * Specs vs. Documentation

this is blurring with git-hub
